The goal of the class is to have the entire project code generated by AI. While it's easy for AI to output short scripts, it behaves as if it forgets the tasks it performed in the past. It's more difficult to generate code that works for the app in a single attempt. In fact, I almost guided the AI on how to write the code. When it comes to showing a rough implementation plan with some basic code, AI excels greatly. However, the truly useful code must still be written by oneself. There are differences in the way I approach implementation compared to AI's approach. Iâ€™ve lost motivation for the project and have no intention of continuing. However, the project is still broken and unusable.
